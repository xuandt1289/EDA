# Exploratory Data Analysis and Applied Machine Learning

This is a collection of some exploration data analysis and applied machine learning projects as Jupyter notebooks.

## Notebooks  

### [New Coders Survey data](https://github.com/xuandt1289/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/main/New%20coders%20survey%20data)

This notebook analyzes [New Coders Survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-?select=2016-FCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv) including more than 15,000 people who are actively learning to code. The goal was to understand these people's motivations in learning to code, how they're learning to code, their demographics, and their socioeconomic background.

### [Trip data](https://github.com/xuandt1289/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Trip%20dataset)

This notebook analyzes Trip data set that is about user travel data that describes the user's driving habits. Apply multiple ML models  to predict the trip satisfaction
