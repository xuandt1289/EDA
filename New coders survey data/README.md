2016 New coder Survey 

The dataset ([link dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-?select=2016-FCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv)) includes more than 15,000 people who are actively learning to code. 
The goal was to understand these people's motivations in learning to code, how they're learning to code, their demographics, and their socioeconomic background.
